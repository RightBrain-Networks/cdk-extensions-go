	// Enable or disable automatic acceptance of attachment requests.
	//
	// When this is enabled, any transit gateway attachments created in other accounts where this

	// Enables auto-discovery of AWS accounts via CDK resources.
	//
	// Account discovery uses stages
	// and stacks to find all accounts that the CDK has resources for.
	//
	// Environment agnostic stages and stacks cannot be used for auto-discovery.
	//
	// With auto-discovery enabled, the stack containing the Transit Gateway will need to be
	// updated before it will become available in newly added accounts. Because of this it is
	// inferior to using grouping principals such as organizations or organizational units.
	//
	// If access to sharing via AWS OIrganizations is available, that should be preferred over
	// auto-discovery.
	//
	// Transit gateway sharing will be anabled if either auto-discovery is enabled or principals
	// are specified.
	AutoDiscovery *bool `field:"optional" json:"autoDiscovery" yaml:"autoDiscovery"`
	// The ID of the default Transit Gateway Route Table that got created for the Transit Gateway associated with this VPC.
	//
	// This is needed because the default route table is used for handling routing of all traffic within
	// the organization but not exposed directly via CloudFormation.
	//
	// See [feature request](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-coverage-roadmap/issues/180)
	// related to this in the AWS CloudFormation roadmap.
	//
	// This is only needed if the VPC is being configured to act as a hub for network traffic. Won't be
	// available until after this stack has been deployed for the first time.
	DefaultRouteTableId *string `field:"optional" json:"defaultRouteTableId" yaml:"defaultRouteTableId"`
	// A list of principals which allow other accounts access to the Transit Gateway.
	//
	// With shared
	// access, other accounts can create Attachments to facilitate cross account networking.
	//
	// Principals provided should not overlap with CDK resources if auto-discovery is enabled.
	//
	// Transit gateway sharing will be anabled if either auto-discovery is enabled or principals
	// are specified.
