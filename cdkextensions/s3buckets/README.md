# Vibe-io CDK-Extensions S3 Buckets Construct Library

The cdk-extensions/s3_buckets package contains advanced constructs and patterns
for setting up S3 Buckets. The constructs presented here are intended to be replacements
for equivalent AWS constructs in the CDK module, but with additional features included.
All defaults follow best practices, and utilize secure settings.

[AWS CDK S3 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3-readme.html)

To import and use this module within your CDK project:

#### Typescript

```go
import * as s3_buckets from 'cdk-extensions/s3-buckets';
```

#### Python

```python
import cdk_extensions.s3_buckets as s3_buckets
```

## Common defaults

All S3 buckets extend the private RawBucket resource, which implements the
[`iBucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.IBucket.html) interface to expose all
resource configurations and creates a [`CfnBucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.CfnBucket.html) resource.

All buckets have a default Removal Policy applied, retaining them if the stack
is deleted.

* **ApplyRemovalPolicy**: Defaults to `RETAIN`.

# AWS Logging Buckets

These buckets are utilized as part of the logging strategy defined by
**stacks/AwsLoggingStack**, but can be deployed individually. When applicable, storing
these logs in S3 offers significant cost savings over CloudWatch. Additionally,
Glue and Athena can be utilized for fast and efficient analysis of data stored in S3.

* [Common Settings](#CommonSettings)
* [Buckets](#Buckets)

  * [AlbLogsBucket](#AlbLogsBucket)
  * [CloudFrontLogsBucket](#CloudFrontLogsBucket)
  * [CloudTrailLogsBucket](#CloudTrailLogsBucket)
  * [FlowLogsBucket](#FlowLogsBucket)
  * [S3AccessLogsBucket](#S3AccessLogsBucket)
  * [SesLogsBucket](#SesLogsBucket)
  * [WafLogsBucket](#WafLogsBucket)

## Common Settings

By default, for each service in the **AwsLoggingStack** a Glue crawler performs
an ETL process to analyze and categorize the stored data and store the associated
metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

Several default named Athena queries are defined that aid in improving the security posture
of your AWS Account. These default named queries have been defined for each AWS
service.

Set `createQueries` to `false` to skip query creation.

*Examples*

**TypeScript**

```go
const alb_bucket_with_queries = new s3_buckets.AlbLogsBucket(this, "AlbLogsBucket")
const cloudtrail_bucket_without_queries = new s3_buckets.CloudtrailBucket(this, 'CloudtrailBucket', {
  createQueries: false
})
```

**Python**

```Python
alb_bucket_with_queries = s3_buckets.AlbLogsBucket(self, 'AlbLogsBucket')

cloudtrail_bucket_without_queries = s3_buckets.CloudTrailLogsBucket(self, 'CloudTrailLogsBucket', create_queries=False)
```

## Buckets

All log buckets are [`CfnBucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.CfnBucket.html) constructs
with the additional secure defaults:

* All `PublicAccessBlockConfiguration` properties default to `true`. (i.e.
  `blockPublicAcls`, `blockPublicPolicy`, `ignorePublicAcls`,
  `restrictPublicBuckets`)
* Versioning is set to `Enabled`
* Server side bucket encryption using AES256
