### Summary

Having a good logging strategy for your AWS Services is a recommended best
practice in every case. It increases operational visibility and strengthens an
enterprise's security posture in a measurable manner.

**It is *recommended*, but it is not always easy to set up, and it is rarely done
for you.**

A good logging strategy for AWS services should utilize the most cost effective,
secure, and reliable solutions available, and include data analysis that can yield
actionable intelligence.

* This will mean storing logs in S3, typically with secure encryption and versioning
  enabled, as well as Cfn Retention set.
* Creating a secure Glue Database for storage and analysis of log data
* Writing custom Glue jobs that can extract and transform logs from S3, and store
  them in the Glue database
* Writing Athena queries tuned for that particular service's log data, that can
  produce good information, and saving them as named queries

The **AwsLoggingStack** sets that up for seven of the AWS services where it
is most frequently needed, handling everything from bucket to query for:

* Application Load Balancer
* CloudFront
* CloudTrail
* VPC FlowLogs
* S3(Access Logs)
* SES
* WAF

S3 Access logging is enabled for all the logging buckets, with logs delivered to the
`S3AccessLogsBucket`.

### Usage

All S3 buckets, Glue resources, and Athena queries are created using **cdk_extensions**
modules. As such, this stack can be initialized with no parameters to rapidly
deploy an industry standard logging strategy into an AWS account, including recommended
named Athena Queries for each service.

#### Install

To import and use this module within your CDK project:

**TypeScript**

```TypeScript
import { AwsLoggingStack } from 'cdk-extensions/stacks';
```

```TypeScript
new AwsLoggingStack(this, 'AwsLoggingStack')
```

**Python**

```Python
from cdk_extensions.stacks import (
AwsLoggingStack
)
```

```Python
aws_logging_stack = AwsLoggingStack(self, 'AwsLoggingStack')
```

#### Enable Logging

**AwsLoggingStack** manages buckets, glue tables, and permissions. All that is left is to
start delivering the logs.

Remember that logging configuration for most **aws-cdk-lib** constructs will require
an L2 construct(i.e. `iBucket`), but the resources created by the AwsLoggingStack
are L1 constructs(i.e. `CfnBucket`). In order to configure **cdk-extensions** logging
buckets, they must be first wrapped in an L2 construct.

```Typescript
logging_stack = new AwsLoggingStack(this, 'LoggingStack')

const l2_cloudtrail_bucket = s3.Bucket.fromCfnBucket(
  logging_stack.cloudtraillogsBucket.resource
);

const trail = new cloudtrail.Trail(this, 'myCloudTrail', {
  bucket: l2_cloudtrail_bucket
});
```

Follow the docs for each service or resource to enable logging to the respective
`AwsLoggingStack` S3 buckets:

* [Enable Logging on an ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer.html#logwbraccesswbrlogsbucket-prefix)
* [Enable Logging on a CloudFront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cloudfront.Distribution.html#logbucket)
* [Create A Trail on CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cloudtrail.Trail.html)
* [Publish VPC Flow Logs to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.FlowLogDestination.html#static-towbrs3bucket-keyprefix-options)
* [Enable Server Access logging for S3 Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.CfnBucket.LoggingConfigurationProperty.html)
* [Stream SES Event logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ses.CfnConfigurationSetEventDestination.EventDestinationProperty.html)
* As described in the documentation linked above, SES event logs first need to
  publish to an intermediate service, such as [Kinesis Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/aws-kinesisfirehose-readme.html#s3), and then be streamed to the S3 bucket(opinionated Firehose constructs are also
  available in [cdk-extensions/kinesis-firehose](../kinesis-firehose))

  * [Enable WAF logging to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_wafv2.CfnLoggingConfiguration.html)

  ### The Athena Queries

  Once beyond the nuts and bolts of setting up logging buckets and glue jobs to get
  important data into a secure format that can be queried, your data provides its best
  value through well written Athena queries that draw out important metrics and actionable
  intelligence. The **AwsLoggingStack** creates a few immediately useful [`CfnNamedQueries`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_athena.CfnNamedQuery.html) for
  each service to get you started.

  #### Application Load Balancer

  Two Athena queries provide valuable insight into traffic to your ALB:

  * **alb-top-ips**: Gets the 100 most active IP addresses by request count.
  * **alb-5xx-errors**: Gets the 100 most recent ELB 5XX responses

  #### CloudFront Distribution

  Four Athena queries provide valuable insight into traffic across your CDNs.

  * **cloudfront-distribution-statistics**: Gets statistics for CloudFront distributions
    for the last day.
  * **cloudfront-request-errors**: Gets the 100 most recent requests that resulted
    in an error from CloudFront.
  * **cloudfront-top-ips**: Gets the 100 most active IP addresses by request count.
  * **cloudfront-top-objects**: Gets the 100 most requested CloudFront objects.

  #### CloudTrail

  Two Athena queries provide valuable insight into user activity on your AWS account.

  * **cloudtrail-unauthorized-errors**: Gets the 100 most recent unauthorized AWS
    API calls.
  * **cloudtrail-user-logins**: Gets the 100 most recent AWS user logins.

  #### VPC FlowLogs

  An Athena query is created to expose info about rejected internal traffic

  * **flow-logs-internal-rejected**: Gets the 100 most recent rejected packets that
    stayed within the private network ranges.

  #### S3 Access Logs

  An Athena query is created that exposes failed attempts to access your S3 buckets

  * **s3-request-errors**: Gets the 100 most recent failed S3 access requests.

  #### SES

  Protect your domain, and your enterprise's, sending reputation by tracking **bounces**
  and **complaints**

  * **ses-bounces**: Gets the 100 most recent bounces from the last day.
  * **ses-complaints**: Gets the 100 most recent complaints from the last day.

  #### WAF

  Strategy is implemented for storage of WAF logs in S3 with ETL jobs loading to the
  Glue table, but no default Athena queries have been added yet.

  ### More Info About The Resources

  This solution utilizes the **AwsLoggingStack** patterns from the **cdk-extensions/glue-tables** and **cdk-extensions/s3-buckets** libraries, which in turn utilize constructs from
  **cdk-extensions** **Glue** and **Athena** libraries. Detailed info about each is
  covered their respective documentation.

  // stack
  const env = {
